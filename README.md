#  Progresso

The system is a **web-based collaborative environment** intended for **team project management**. Facilitate creation and structuring of projects, task creation, tracking progress, and communication via comments. The system should be designed in a way that it supports **secure permission management** where different categories of users (e.g., *administrators*, *project managers*, and *team members*) can access different functionalities.

Developed with **Angular**, the user interface is simple and facilitates easy and efficient visualization and interaction with the data related to the projects. The backend, developed using **Java** and **Spring Boot**, manages business logic and data access via a **repository** and **service structure**.

This project was developed as part of a **Bachelor‚Äôs thesis in Computer Science** at the **University of Salerno (UNISA)**. The system was designed to maximize collaboration and support project management, making it suitable for a variety of organizational contexts and team structures, with a focus on **effectiveness** and **scalability**.

  - **TypeScript**: JavaScript superset that supports optional static typing and is used with Angular.

- **Backend:**

  - **Java**: Programming language to develop the backend.
  - **Spring Boot**: A mechanism for developing stand-alone, production-ready Spring-based applications. It has an abundance of features to expedite the development of backend applications.
  - **Spring Security**: A module of the Spring framework, used for authentication, authorization, and other security operations in a Spring Boot app.
  - **Spring Data JPA**: One of the pieces of the Spring Data project, it simplifies data access using JPA (Java Persistence API) to talk to databases. Hibernate is the built-in JPA provider for ORM capabilities.
  - **MySQL**: Relational database used to store the application's data.

- **Build & Dependency Management:**
  - **Maven**: A build automation tool used for managing dependencies and packaging.
  - **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for the frontend build and running development tools.

- **Version Control:**
  - **Git**: Version control system to manage the source code.
  - **GitHub**: Git repository hosting platform used to store the project.

- **Testing:**
  - **JUnit**: A framework for writing and running tests in Java.
  - **Mockito**: A Java-based mocking framework used in unit tests.
  - **Selenium IDE**: A browser automation tool that helps in automating web application testing by recording and playing back user interactions with the browser. It's used for automating frontend tests in the web-based project.

- **Other Tools:**
  - **Postman**: API testing tool used to test the backend APIs.

<h2 id="features">‚ú® Main Features</h2>

- üîê **Role-based access control**: Different permissions for Admins, Project Managers, and Team Members.
- üìÅ **Project and task management**: Create, update, assign, and track tasks within projects.
- üí¨ **Comment system**: Users can communicate directly within each project via comments.
- üìä **Progress tracking**: Visual indicators of task and project status.
- üîé **Secure authentication**: Login system protected via Spring Security.

<h2 id="installation">üì¶ Installation</h2>

### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Before you start

Make sure **Git** is installed (required for cloning the repo and submodules):

```bash
git --version
```
If you don‚Äôt have it, install from [here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.49.0.windows.1/Git-2.49.0-64-bit.exe).
### üîß Backend Setup

#### Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your system:

- [Java 17](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin17-binaries/releases/download/jdk-17.0.15%2B6/OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_17.0.15_6.msi)
- [MySQL 8 (select the full installation)](https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQLInstaller/mysql-installer-web-community-8.0.42.0.msi)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

#### 1. Clone the repository with submodules

This project uses Git submodules for frontend and backend. Open a terminal where you want to clone the repository and execute:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/esetaro2/progresso.git
```
<strong>If you forgot <code>--recurse-submodules</code></strong>, run this:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### 2. Configure environment variables

Move to the "progresso" folder and open a new terminal, set the following environment variables so that Spring Boot picks up your credentials and secret.

- ##### Linux / macOS (bash, zsh, etc.)
  ```bash
  export DB_USER="your_mysql_username"
  export DB_PASS="your_mysql_password"
  export JWT_SECRET="KVZy7tPsOHBKTdqzKGKYOJibEq54pI0QJ7ytfuJnjxw="
  ```
  To verify:
  ```bash
  echo $DB_USER
  echo $DB_PASS
  echo $JWT_SECRET
  ```
  
- ##### Windows PowerShell
  ```bash
  $env:DB_USER = "your_mysql_username"
  $env:DB_PASS = "your_mysql_password"
  $env:JWT_SECRET = "KVZy7tPsOHBKTdqzKGKYOJibEq54pI0QJ7ytfuJnjxw="
  ```
  To verify:
  ```bash
  echo $env:DB_USER
  echo $env:DB_PASS
  echo $env:JWT_SECRET
  ```

- ##### Windows (cmd.exe)
  ```bash
  set DB_USER=your_mysql_username
  set DB_PASS=your_mysql_password
  set JWT_SECRET=KVZy7tPsOHBKTdqzKGKYOJibEq54pI0QJ7ytfuJnjxw=
  ```
  To verify:
   ```bash
   echo %DB_USER%
   echo %DB_PASS%
   echo %JWT_SECRET%
   ```

#### 3. Set up the MySQL database

##### 1. Open MySQL workbench and start the server.
##### 2. Create a new database:

```bash
CREATE SCHEMA progresso CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
USE progresso;
```

#### 4. Build and run the backend

Return to the previous terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
cd progresso_backend
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### üîß Frontend Setup
#### Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your system:

- [Node.js (v22 or higher)](https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.15.1/node-v22.15.1-x64.msi)
- [Angular CLI (v19)](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/setup-local)

#### 1. Verify Node.js version
Open a new terminal and execute:

```bash
node --version
```
#### 2. Verify Angular CLI version
```bash
ng version
```
If you need to update:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

#### 3. Navigate to the frontend module
Open a new terminal and execute:
```bash
cd path/to/progresso-frontend
```
*Tip: You can open the terminal directly in the `progresso-frontend` folder by right-clicking inside the folder in File Explorer (Windows) and selecting "Open in Terminal", or use the equivalent on your OS.*

#### 4. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
#### 5. Serve the application
```bash
ng serve
