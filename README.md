# Progresso

The system is a **web-based collaborative environment** intended for **team project management**. Facilitate creation and structuring of projects, task creation, tracking progress, and communication via comments. The system should be designed in a way that it supports **secure permission management** where different categories of users (e.g., *administrators*, *project managers*, and *team members*) can access different functionalities.

Developed with **Angular**, the user interface is simple and facilitates easy and efficient visualization and interaction with the data related to the projects. The backend, developed using **Java** and **Spring Boot**, manages business logic and data access via a **repository** and **service structure**.

This project was developed as part of a **Bachelor’s thesis** during an *external internship* at the IT company **IT Svil Srl**. The system was designed to maximize collaboration and support project management, making it suitable for a variety of organizational contexts and team structures, with a focus on **effectiveness** and **scalability**.
